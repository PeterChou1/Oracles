## Create an Oracle:

> Build based on a problem: 
>
> ​	Create services based on issues in existing Oracle services/structure.
>
> Build something new: 
>
> ​	By combining multiple topics, E.g., Orcale+{ZK, Bridge, Stablecoin, Automation, Detect Vulnerabilities}

1. Build generalized oracle nodes hosted on existing chains (Smart Contract). 

   - Not like Chainlink running its LINK chain/coin.
   - I haven't thought about what's the benefit.
   
2. Oracle + DNS or ENS?
   - Is there anything that could go wrong or pass chainlink's tamper-proof to return a fake IP address for "Apple.com"?

     | -> address               | -> IP address                                                |
     | -> IPFS object           | -> server object                                             |




## Using existing Oracle:

1. Create Oracle that uses/combines all other oracles: DIA+Chainlink+Band Protocol

2. Use Chainlink:

   - Use Chainlink

   - Use Chainlink/Market Data

   - Use Chainlink/Weather Data
     - Classic example: Insurance Smart Contract that execution depends on Oracle data.
   
   - Use Chainlink/Sports Data
   
   - Use Chainlink/Automation
   
   - Use Chainlink/Randomness
   
   - Use Chainlink/AnyAPI
